Could we build something that lets users dynamically configure their plots via drag&drop from a list of possible primitives 
which would be linked to incoming data?

1. The user would start with picking either svg or canvas to use.
2. The user would then select elements whose properties (e.g. x,y) he can link to incoming socket data or predetermine (e.g. size)
3. Optionally the user could potentially add things like axis or legends etc

The code would obviously need to make certain assumptions (especially about the way elements are
handled internally) and allow only a couple of possible interactions but maybe those can 
already be useful enough to construct useful custom charts easily.
